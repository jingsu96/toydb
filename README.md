# ToyDB - A Simple Database Implementation in Go

## Overview

ToyDB is an educational database implementation inspired by [Let's Build a Simple Database](https://cstack.github.io/db_tutorial/), built in Go as a learning project. This implementation provides a hands-on exploration of database internals, from parsing SQL-like commands to managing data storage with B-trees.

## Architecture

### Frontend Components
- **Tokenizer**: Breaks input into meaningful tokens
- **Parser**: Analyzes token sequences to build abstract syntax trees
- **Code Generator**: Converts parsed statements into executable bytecode

### Backend Components
- **Virtual Machine**: Executes generated bytecode operations
- **B-tree**: Efficient index structure for data organization
- **Pager**: Manages memory pages and disk I/O operations
- **OS Interface**: Abstracts operating system interactions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose

### Running ToyDB

```bash
# Build the development container
docker-compose build toydb-dev

# Start the database shell
docker-compose run --rm toydb-dev
```

## Supported Operations

### INSERT Statement
Add new records to the database:

```sql
db > insert 1 user1 user1@gmail.com
Executed.
db > insert 2 user2 user2@gmail.com
Executed.
db > insert 3 user3 user3@gmail.com
Executed.
```

### SELECT Statement
Retrieve all records from the database:

```sql
db > select
(1, user1, user1@gmail.com)
(2, user2, user2@gmail.com)
(3, user3, user3@gmail.com)
Executed.
```

### B-tree Inspection
View the internal B-tree structure:

```sql
db > .btree
Tree:
- leaf (size 3)
    - key 1
    - key 2
    - key 3
```

## Learning Objectives

This project serves as a practical implementation for understanding:
- Database query parsing and execution
- B-tree data structures for indexing
- Memory management and paging systems
- Virtual machine design for database operations
- File I/O and persistence mechanisms

## Development Status

Currently supports basic `INSERT` and `SELECT` operations. The project is actively developed as part of the learning journey in Go programming and database internals.

## Contributing

This is primarily an educational project, but suggestions and improvements are welcome through GitHub issues or pull requests.
