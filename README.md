## ToyDB

This project is inspired by [Let's Build a Simple Database](https://cstack.github.io/db_tutorial/), but implemented in Go, the language I’m currently learning.

## Concept

The front-end consists of:

- Tokenizer
- Parser
- Code Generator


The back-end consists of:

- Virtual Machine
- B-tree
- Pager
- OS Interface
